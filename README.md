# ðŸ¤– AutoCommit

AutoCommit is a command-line tool that uses the power of AI to automatically generate clear, conventional, and descriptive `git` commit messages for you. It analyzes your staged changes, understands the context, and proposes a commit message that follows the **Conventional Commits** specification.

## Features

  * **ðŸ§  AI-Generated Messages**: Leverages powerful AI models to understand your code changes and write meaningful commit messages.
  * **âœ… Conventional Commits**: Enforces the Conventional Commits standard out of the box for a clean and readable git history.
  * **ðŸ”Œ Multi-Provider Support**: Works with a wide range of AI providers, including cloud services (OpenAI, Mistral, Groq) and local inference using **Ollama**.
  * **ðŸ‘† Interactive Menu**: Provides a simple menu to commit, regenerate, copy the message to the clipboard, or exit.
  * **Smart Diff Analysis**: Automatically ignores noisy files like `package-lock.json` to improve the quality of the AI's analysis.
  * **ðŸ”§ Customizable**: Power users can override the default AI instructions to tailor the commit message style to their needs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

  * **OS Compatibility**: This tool is designed for Unix-like systems (e.g., Linux, macOS, and WSL on Windows). It is not tested on native Windows environments.
  * **Git**: For version control.
  * **curl** or **wget**: For downloading the script.
  * **jq**: For processing JSON.
  * **Ollama** (Optional): Required if you want to run local AI models. You can download it from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com).

## Installation

You can install `autocommit` with a single command. Just paste this into your terminal:

### One-Line Install (Recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skediaio/autocommit/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual Install (for inspection)

If you'd prefer to inspect the script before running it:

```bash
# 1. Download the script
curl -L -o install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skediaio/autocommit/main/install.sh

# 2. Review the script (optional)
cat install.sh

# 3. Run the installer
bash install.sh
```

The installer will place the `autocommit` script in `$HOME/.local/bin` and make it executable. If this directory is not in your `PATH`, the script will provide instructions on how to add it.

-----

## Configuration

First, run the interactive configuration guide:

```bash
autocommit configure
```

This will walk you through selecting a provider and model.

If you are using **Ollama**, make sure you have pulled the recommended model. This command will download it if you don't have it yet:

```bash
ollama run gemma2:9b-instruct-q4_K_M
```

The interactive guide will help you:

1.  **Choose an AI provider**: Select **Ollama** for a fast, free, and private local experience.
2.  **Select a model**: The recommended default is `gemma2:9b-instruct-q4_K_M`.
3.  **Enter API Keys** (if using a cloud provider).

Your settings will be saved to `~/.autocommit/config.json`.

-----

## Usage

Using `autocommit` is simple and fits right into your existing workflow.

1.  **Stage your files** as you normally would:

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

2.  **Run the tool**:

    ```bash
    autocommit
    ```

3.  The AI will generate a commit message. Use the **interactive menu** to commit the changes, regenerate the message, or copy it to your clipboard.

## Advanced Usage

### Environment Variables

You can override your saved configuration at runtime using environment variables. This is useful for temporary changes or for use in CI/CD pipelines.

| Variable                 | Description                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `AUTOCOMMIT_PROVIDER`    | Set the AI provider (e.g., `ollama`, `openai`).   |
| `AUTOCOMMIT_MODEL`       | Set the specific model name (e.g., `llama3:8b`).    |
| `AUTOCOMMIT_API_KEY`     | Provide an API key.                               |
| `AUTOCOMMIT_BASE_URL`    | Set a custom API endpoint.                        |
| `AUTOCOMMIT_MAX_DIFF_CHARS` | Set the max characters of the diff sent to the AI. |
| `AUTOCOMMIT_DEBUG=1`     | Enable debug mode to see API requests/responses.  |

### Customizing the AI Prompt

You can completely override the default system prompt and instructions sent to the AI. To do this, create a file at `~/.autocommit/instructions.txt`.

If this file exists, `autocommit` will use its contents as the instructions for the AI, giving you full control over the tone, style, and format of the generated messages.
